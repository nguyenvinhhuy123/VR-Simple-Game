# VR Simple Game
## Project of Game Programming Course HK232.

## Unity Version: 2022.3.22f1
**Note** : Some detail that need to keep in mind when compile this project are: 

We are currently developing our game using Unity Engine version 2022.3.22f1. Similar versions of Unity (3.21f, 3.22f , etc.) are usable but not recommended.

The XR package use in the project are: OpenXR plugin version 1.10.0, XR Core Utilities 2.3.0, XR Hands 1.4.0, XR Interaction Toolkit 2.5.4, XR Legacy Input Helper 2.1.10, XR Plugin Management 4.4.1.

We are trying our best to make our project compatible for different XR Package version. But this is not guaranty. If there is any issue during your process, feel free to open an issue via GitHub.
